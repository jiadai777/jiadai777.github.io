          <p>
            My name is Jason Liu and I am a recent SFSU graduate who holds a Master's Degree in English from SFSU and a Bachelor's Degree in Managerial Economics from UC Davis. I am a part-time instructor at Skyline College. Throughout my secondary and post-secondary education, I tutored and taught many students of different ages, classes, and subjects. I want to expand my teaching career by developing my own unique teaching style and curriculum. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The classroom will be in a spacious room at my house where I live with my parents. Since I just started this home business, I strive our best to build up my reputation, therefore I am offering low prices to attract more students. As I gain more capital resources, I will gradually expand and enhance my educational spaces and facilities, providing better and better educational experiences to more and more students.
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all, you or your children's educational growth is also my growth, so let's work together along the journey!
